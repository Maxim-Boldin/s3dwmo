							</p> The Cloud Resume Challenge represents a cornerstone project in my portfolio, embodying the practical application of my cloud computing knowledge and web development skills. This initiative involved designing and deploying a personal resume as a static website, utilizing a suite of cloud
							 services and technologies primarily within the AWS ecosystem. Key aspects of this project included: </p>
                            </p>•	Website Design and Deployment: Developed a responsive and aesthetically pleasing resume website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and browsers. The website was deployed on Amazon S3, leveraging its
							 capabilities for static website hosting to ensure high availability and global accessibility.</p>
						    </p>•	Serverless Architecture: Incorporated AWS Lambda to add dynamic functionality to the website without the need for traditional server infrastructure. This approach exemplified the use of serverless 
							computing, showcasing my ability to implement scalable and efficient cloud solutions.</p>
					        </p>•	API Integration: Utilized Amazon API Gateway to create a RESTful API, facilitating communication between the front-end website and back-end services. This integration demonstrated my proficiency 
							in developing and managing APIs in a cloud environment.</p>
						    </p>•	Database Management: Employed Amazon DynamoDB for storing and retrieving data, specifically to implement a visitor count feature on the website. This experience with AWS’s NoSQL database service highlighted my skills 
							in database design and management within cloud applications.</p>
						    </p>•	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, automating the deployment process for both the website and serverless functions. This ensured that updates were efficiently rolled out to the production environment upon 
							code commits, emphasizing my commitment to modern development practices and automation.</p>  
						    </p>•	Domain Management and DNS Configuration: Configured a custom domain for the website using Amazon Route 53, enhancing the project’s professional 
							appearance and demonstrating my ability to manage DNS settings in a cloud context.</p>
						    </p>•	Amazon CloudFront Integration(waiting on certificate): Leveraged Amazon CloudFront to distribute the resume website content globally with low latency and high transfer speeds, ensuring an optimized user experience regardless of geographical location. This Content Delivery Network (CDN) service was instrumental in enhancing website performance and reliability, 
							demonstrating my ability to architect solutions that are both scalable and user-centric.</p>
						    </p>	•	Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Employed Terraform to define and provision the cloud infrastructure required for the project in a repeatable and predictable manner. By scripting the setup of AWS resources, including S3 buckets, Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB tables, and CloudFront distributions, 
							I showcased a sophisticated approach to infrastructure management. This not only streamlined the deployment process but also ensured consistency and compliance across development and production environments.</p>
						    </p>This project not only served as a practical showcase of my cloud computing and web development abilities but also reinforced my initiative as a self-motivated learner, eager to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios. Through the Cloud Resume Challenge, I have effectively demonstrated a comprehensive understanding 
							of cloud services, serverless architecture, and automated deployment strategies, underscoring my readiness to contribute to innovative cloud solutions in the tech industry.</p>
